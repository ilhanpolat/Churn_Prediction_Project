# Employee Churn Analysis Project 
# Building classification models for a variety of business settings.
# Done Exploratory data analysis and visualization of employee churn dataset using matplotlib and seaborn, model building and evaluation using python scikit-learn and Tensorflow-Keras packages.
# Implementing classification techniques in Python. Using Scikit-Learn allows for making predictions with Distance Based, Bagging, and Boosting algorithms for this project. On the other hand, for Deep Learning I use Tensorflow-Keras.
# I will deploy my model using Streamlit, soon.
